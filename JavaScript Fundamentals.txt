JavaScript Fundamentals:

1. What is JavaScript?(Browser + Server)
. JavaScript is the language of the web.
. It calculates, manipulates, validates data.
. update and change both html & CSS.
. JavaScript files have the file extension .js.


JavaScript Can Change HTML Content:
.JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().
. JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes.

The <script> Tag:
. In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

JavaScript Functions and Events:
. A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.

JavaScript in <head>:
. A JavaScript function is placed in the <head> section of an HTML page.
  The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked.

JavaScript in <body>:
. A JavaScript function is placed in the <body> section of an HTML page.
The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked.

External JavaScript:
. Scripts can also be placed in external files.
. ex: <script src="myScript.js"></script>
. External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.

JavaScript Output:
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

. Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML or innerText.
. Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
. Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
. Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
. you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window.

JavaScript Syntax:
. The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
Literals (Fixed values)-Numbers are written with or without decimals.
Variables (Variable values) - Strings are text, written within double or single quotes.
. JavaScript keywords are used to defines actions to be performed.
. The let and const keywords create variables
. JavaScript keywords are case-sensitive.


JavaScript Variables:
. Variables are containers for storing data values.
. Variables must be identified with unique names.
. You declare a JavaScript variable with the let keyword or the const keyword.
. var vs let vs const:
. var: Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.
       Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.
       Variables defined with var can be redeclared.	

. let: use let if the value should be changed. Only use let if you cannot use const.
       Variables declared with let have Block Scope.
       Variables declared with let must be Declared before use.
       Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope

. const: use const if the value and type should not be changed


JavaScript Identifiers:
. An identifier is the name you give to a variable.
. Rules for identifiers:
Must start with a letter, _, or $
Can contain digits after the first character
Cannot be a reserved keyword (let, const, if, etc.)
Are case-sensitive

JavaScript Keywords:
. JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Keyword	Description:
var	Declares a variable
let	Declares a block variable
const	Declares a block constant
if	Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch	Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for	Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function	Declares a function
return	Exits a function
try	Implements error handling to a block of statements

JavaScript Comments:
. JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
. JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.
. Single line comments start with //.
. Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

JavaScript Data Types:
. Type			Description
String		A text of characters enclosed in quotes
Number		A number representing a mathematical value
Bigint		A number representing a large integer
Boolean		A data type representing true or false
Object		A collection of key-value pairs of data
Undefined	A primitive variable with no assigned value
Null		A primitive value representing object absence
Symbol		A unique and primitive identifier
